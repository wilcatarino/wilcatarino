## 🧑‍💻 About:

💻 On the professional side, Software Engineer experienced in Software Development, Software Architecture and People Leadership. I consider myself a fast and eager leaner, have passion for tech solutions and delivery real value.

💙 On the personal side, I love my family, my dog ​​(a cute Jack Russell Terrier) and being able to have fun traveling in my free time.

🤔 However, I have sure we are just one and I believe all sides blend together... I really like a Simon Sinek obvious statement: "100% of customers are people. 100% of employees are people. If you don't understand people, you don't understands business"
